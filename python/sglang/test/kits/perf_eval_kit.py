"""Data-driven performance harness for the PPU benchmark suites.

This is the serving-throughput sibling of :mod:`answer_eval_kit`.  It carries no
grading logic of its own: a measurement produces the numbers
``sglang.bench_serving`` already computes -- time to first token and token
throughput above all -- and the report records them.  Nothing here compares a
number against a threshold, because no threshold has been measured on this
hardware yet; what turns a run red is an inability to measure, not a slow
result.  See :func:`measurement_record` for the exact boundary.

The module is deliberately free of ``torch`` and of anything that touches a
device, so the unit tests can validate every config and render every report on a
laptop.  The half that has to import ``sglang.test.test_utils`` -- and through it
``torch`` -- lives in :mod:`perf_suite_kit`.

The configs this validates are ported from the internal btv1.5 corpus under
``model-test-cases/testcases/btv1.5/llm_infer_sglang/144G/Daily/Prefill``.  Where
a name differs between that corpus and SGLang, the SGLang spelling is what a
config states, and the mapping is recorded in the suite's README: btv1.5 writes
``tp`` and ``ep`` for what SGLang calls ``tp_size`` and ``ep_size``, and states
``mem_fraction_static`` as a string.
