"""The half of the PPU performance harness that needs a device and a server.

:mod:`perf_eval_kit` stays hardware-free so the unit suite can validate every
config on a laptop; this module is the part that imports ``torch`` through
``sglang.test.test_utils`` and drives ``sglang.bench_serving`` against a live
server, so only the PPU performance test files import it.  Those files exist one
per device topology because ``register_ppu_ci`` registers a suite per file, and
everything else that differs between models lives in the reviewed test config,
so the mixin below is the entire body of such a test.

It is a plain mixin rather than a ``TestCase`` subclass for the same reason
``AnswerSuiteMixin`` is: the test files are executed as ``python3 <file> -f``,
and ``unittest.main()`` collects every ``TestCase`` subclass it finds in the
module namespace, so a shared base class would also run itself with no
configuration selected.

One server, several measurements.  A config states every workload its
checkpoint is measured under, and they share a single launch: loading a 2.4T
checkpoint costs more than the measurements do, and re-launching per workload
would spend the nightly budget on model loading.  What keeps them from
contaminating each other is an explicit flush of the KV cache between them,
asserted rather than assumed -- see :meth:`PerfSuiteMixin._flush_cache`.

        guard all exist; the assignments after it are the ones it does not take
        as parameters and whose defaults are wrong for this suite:

        ``random_range_ratio`` -- its default of 0.0 draws each length from
        ``[0, requested]``, which measures a distribution rather than the length
        the case names.  The reviewed configs state 1.0, which pins it.

        ``tokenize_prompt`` -- sends the prompt to ``/generate`` as ids rather
        than as text, so the prompt length the server sees is the requested one
        exactly.  Without it the ids are decoded to text and re-encoded by the
        server, and a 64k-token prefill measurement would be attributed to a
        length nobody chose.  ``run_benchmark`` asserts this needs the
        ``sglang`` backend, which is the backend below.

        ``model`` and ``served_model_name`` -- left as None,
        ``run_benchmark`` asks ``/v1/models`` for the name and exits the process
        on failure.  Naming both here keeps the measurement independent of that
        round trip and makes the served name in the request identical to the one
        the server was launched with.

        ``tokenizer`` is the checkpoint path for the same reason: it is what
        ``get_tokenizer`` loads with ``trust_remote_code``, and these
        checkpoints define their own tokenizer classes.

        ``output_file`` -- ``benchmark`` appends its raw result to a JSONL file
        unconditionally, deriving a name in the current working directory when
        this is None.  Pointing it into the evidence directory is what makes
        that write a collected artifact instead of a stray file next to
        whatever the runner happened to cd into.

        ``output_details`` -- puts the per-request lengths, TTFTs and errors in
        that file as well, which is the raw evidence behind every number in the
        report.

        ``flush_cache`` -- ``benchmark`` flushes once after its own warmup, so
        the measured phase never reuses what the warmup left behind.  This suite
