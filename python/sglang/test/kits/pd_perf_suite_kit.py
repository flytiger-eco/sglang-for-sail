"""The half of the PPU disaggregated performance harness that needs devices.

:mod:`pd_perf_eval_kit` stays hardware-free so every PD config can be validated
and every command line rendered on a laptop; this module is the part that imports
``torch``, launches the three processes a disaggregated run is made of and drives
``sglang.bench_serving`` against the router in front of them.

What a node does depends only on the rank it was handed, because a PD group is
one workflow job running one registered file on every pod:

  rank 0        a prefill server, the router, the benchmark, the report
  other ranks   their own role's server, and nothing else until rank 0 is done

The two roles do not join one process group -- each server is a rank 0 of its
own -- so there is no rendezvous address to agree on.  What they have to exchange
is an HTTP endpoint, and they exchange it the way the colocated multi-node suites
exchange a device inventory: through the shared results directory on NAS, one
small file per rank, written staged-and-renamed because a reader on NFS can
otherwise observe a partial file.  Each node publishes its endpoint as soon as its
server process exists rather than once that server is ready, so neither role can
be left waiting on the other before either has finished loading a checkpoint; the
readiness of a peer is then established over HTTP, against the endpoint it
published.

One launch, several measurements, as on the colocated line and for the same
reason: loading these checkpoints twice costs more than the measurements do.  A
measurement is graded by the same rule -- red only when it produced no numbers,
never for being slow -- and reported through the same record shape, so the
evidence collector reads a PD report without knowing one exists.
