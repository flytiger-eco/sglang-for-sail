"""Data-driven performance harness for the PPU prefill/decode-disaggregated suites.

The disaggregated sibling of :mod:`perf_eval_kit`, and it borrows that module's
whole second half: a measurement here produces the same numbers, is graded by the
same rule -- red only when it produced no numbers, never for being slow -- and is
reported through the same record shape, so ``collect_perf_evidence.sh`` reads a PD
report without knowing one exists.  What cannot be borrowed is the first half.  A
disaggregated run is not one server with more arguments:

  * Two servers, launched with different arguments from one checkpoint.  The
    btv1.5 PD cases state them apart -- ``prefill_args`` and ``decode_args`` --
    and the two disagree on the attention backend, the memory fraction, the
    scheduler and the parallelism, so a single ``server.parameters`` block could
    not describe the run.
  * A router in front of them, which is what the benchmark posts to.
  * A KV path between them over RDMA, which the flat schema has no field for.
  * Whole boards per role, so the tensor-parallel degree is checked against the
    devices of that role's nodes rather than against the group's.

Hence a second schema rather than a wider one: ``ppu-pd-perf-test-config/v1``.
The reviewed sections a PD config shares with a colocated one -- hardware, model,
workload -- are validated by that module's own functions, so the two lines cannot
drift on what a checkpoint or a measurement is.

Like :mod:`perf_eval_kit` this module is free of ``torch`` and of anything that
touches a device, so every config can be validated and every command line
rendered on a laptop; the half that launches the three processes lives in
:mod:`pd_perf_suite_kit`.

The configs this validates are ported from
``model-test-cases/testcases/btv1.5/llm_infer_sglang/144G/Daily/PD-Disaggregation/notune``
and their launch commands from the ``PD Disaggregation`` section of the matching
``model-site-cases/server_cmds/LLM_Serving/BTV1.5`` page.  The suite's README
records every departure from those commands.
