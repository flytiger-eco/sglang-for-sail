"""The half of the Accuracy line that needs torch, a server, and EvalScope.

`accuracy_eval_kit` stays hardware-free so the CPU unit test can exercise the
whole contract; this module owns the live server and the `evalscope` subprocess,
so only the registered PPU Accuracy test files import it.  Those files exist one
per model and dataset because `register_ppu_ci` registers a suite per file, and
everything that differs between them lives in the reviewed test config, so the
mixin below is the entire body of such a test.

It is a plain mixin rather than a `TestCase` subclass for the same reason
`AnswerSuiteMixin` is: the test files run as `python3 <file> -f`, and
`unittest.main()` collects every `TestCase` subclass in the module namespace, so
a shared base class would also run itself with no configuration selected.

Unlike the Answer and perf lines this one is single-node only, and the schema
says so by having no `nnodes`.  Every internal `P0_daily` case this line is
ported from serves its model on one board, so the rank directory, the device
inventory exchange and the worker release sentinel would all be machinery with
no case behind it.
