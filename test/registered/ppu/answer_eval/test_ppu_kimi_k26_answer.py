"""PPU nightly Answer entries for Kimi-K2.6 (ZW-M890P, eight devices).

Two reviewed configs share this file:

  configs/kimi2.6/w4a8-int8-144g.json    the default below
  configs/kimi2.6/mxfp4-fp8-144g.json

Both take their server arguments from the internal btv1.5 answer_144g case
`kimi-k2.6-w8a8-int8_3001`, which serves this model without a unified attention
backend: it names a prefill and a decode backend instead (fa3 and flashmla).
The checkpoints the cluster holds are quantized differently from that case, so
`quantization` is left unset and each one's own `quantization_config` decides.
The format that case does name, W8A8-INT8, is a two-node entry in
`test_ppu_kimi_k26_w8a8_answer.py`: at 968.3 GiB it does not fit one board group.

The reasoning switch this model's chat template reads is spelled `thinking`, not
`enable_thinking`, and SGLang's `kimi_k2` detector agrees -- it declares
`reasoning_default` "thinking".  Both configs therefore pass
`chat_template_kwargs {"thinking": false}` to keep the answers comparable with
the other non-thinking entries.
