# Carry one Answer entry's report off the NAS onto the run page and into the
# artifact directory.
#
# Run by every entry of test-ppu-answer-k8s.yml in the orchestration shell, held
# here for the same reason the board-side body is: those jobs cannot call a local
# composite action, because their runner resolves `uses: ./` on its own
# filesystem rather than in the container the checkout populated (measured, run
# 34085102675).
#
# The action carries no files out of the worker pod, only its logs, so the report
# travels over the NAS both sides mount: the pod writes under /mnt/wl_nas and
# this shell reads the same bytes under /wl_nas.
#
# Reads:
#   ENTRY                     entry name, and what keeps eight parallel jobs'
#                             annotations apart on one run page -- the suite name
#                             would not, three entries share one
#   ANSWER_RESULTS_ON_RUNNER  the run's own report directory on the NAS
#
# Usage: bash scripts/ci/ppu/collect_answer_evidence.sh

# even when the suite passed, which is how the first run on this board reported
# itself. What is left behind is a few kilobytes under a directory this run owns
# exclusively, and it doubles as the on-cluster record once the artifact expires.
