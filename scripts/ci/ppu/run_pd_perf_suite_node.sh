# Run one node's share of a prefill/decode-disaggregated performance entry.
#
# A PD group is two pods of one job: each runs this script, is told by the action
# which rank it is, and serves the role the reviewed config assigns to that rank.
# Rank 0 also runs the router the benchmark posts to and owns the report; the
# other node serves its half of the KV path and holds its board until rank 0 is
# done.  Neither of those decisions is made here -- they are made in
# `pd_perf_suite_kit` off the config -- so this script is only the setup a board
# needs before the suite can run, plus the per-node log every pod but worker-0
# would otherwise lose.
#
# A separate script from run_perf_suite_board.sh rather than a flag on it, for the
# reason that one is separate from the Answer board script: the two lines read
# different environment variables on purpose, so a change made for one cannot move
# the other's config.  What it does share is the tail -- run_perf_suite_node.sh --
# because keeping a node's log and its exact exit status is the same problem here.
#
# One thing the multi-node colocated entry does and this one deliberately does
# not: it derives no rendezvous address.  The two servers of a PD group do not
# join one process group -- each is a rank 0 of its own eight devices -- so there
# is nothing to meet at.  What the nodes exchange instead is an HTTP endpoint,
# published through the results directory by the suite itself.

# The RoCE GID index, which the Mooncake transfer engine needs told even though
# no collective here crosses the node boundary -- each server is tp 8 inside one
# board, so pccl never leaves it, and what does leave it is the KV path.
# Mooncake picks the GID itself and cannot pick one here: its automatic discovery
# requires an IPv4-mapped-IPv6 GID, and these bonds carry no IPv4 at all, so it
# rejects every entry of a six-entry table and opens nothing --
# "No suitable GID found on mlx5_bond_1/", then "Failed to open device
# mlx5_bond_1 on port  with GID -1" on all four bonds, then a transfer engine
# that fails to initialize and a server that dies twenty seconds in.  That is
# upstream Mooncake #1593, and the first dispatch of this line hit it.  Told the
# index explicitly, Mooncake uses it: it reads MC_GID_INDEX first and falls back
# to NCCL_IB_GID_INDEX only in versions that carry that fallback, so the Mooncake
# name is the one set here -- and only that one, since NCCL_IB_GID_INDEX would
# also reach a pccl that currently works without it.  The script is the
# collective line's, because it reads sysfs rather than a suite's config: among
# the GIDs that are not link-local it takes the highest index, the RoCE v2 entry
# of the routable fd03::/8 address, and refuses to print a number if the devices
# of a host disagree.

# And the HTTP hops that must not go through a proxy.  Every one this line makes
# is inside the cluster: a server warming itself up over its own routable
# address, rank 0 waiting for its peer's `/health`, the benchmark posting to the
# router, and the router reaching both servers.  On the second dispatch of this
# line the first of those never arrived -- the prefill server's own
# `/model_info` came back as an nginx 404 for the full two minutes of the warmup
# loop while the uvicorn bound to that exact address logged no request at all,
# and the server was killed as a failed initialization.  Nothing here names a
# proxy: not this script, not the workflow, not the distributed action, and not
# the source commands this case was ported from.  So the bypass is what this line
# can set, and the variables it inherited are printed below, which is what tells
# a repeat of that 404 apart from a transparent redirect.
#
# `requests`, which the warmup and every readiness poll use, and the router's
# Rust client both read `no_proxy` and both accept a CIDR block; the benchmark's
# aiohttp reads neither, so it was never at risk.  The block is this node's own
# /24 -- the peer's out-of-band address is on it, so a peer discovered at runtime
# needs nothing added -- plus loopback, for the router the benchmark posts to.
# The address is the source of the default route, which is the one SGLang itself
# resolves to and publishes as this node's endpoint.
