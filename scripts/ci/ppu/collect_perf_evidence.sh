# Carry one performance entry's report off the NAS onto the run page and into the
# artifact directory.
#
# Run by every entry of the three test-ppu-perf-*-k8s.yml workflows in the
# orchestration shell, held here for the same reason the board-side body is:
# those jobs cannot call a local composite action, because their runner resolves
# `uses: ./` on its own filesystem rather than in the container the checkout
# populated (measured, run 34085102675).
#
# The action carries no files out of the worker pod, only its logs, so the report
# travels over the NAS both sides mount: the pod writes under /mnt/wl_nas and this
# shell reads the same bytes under /wl_nas.
#
# What reaches the run page is the numbers themselves, as notices, one per
# measurement.  That is the whole delivery mechanism of this line: the suite
# judges nothing, so a green run whose numbers nobody can see would have measured
# nothing usable.  A measurement that produced no numbers becomes an error, and a
# measurement the evaluator flagged -- a prompt length that came back different
# from the one asked for, requests that failed -- becomes a warning.
#
# Reads:
#   ENTRY                   entry name, and what keeps parallel jobs'
#                           annotations apart on one run page
#   PERF_RESULTS_ON_RUNNER  the run's own report directory on the NAS
#
# Usage: bash scripts/ci/ppu/collect_perf_evidence.sh

# reported itself. What is left behind is a few kilobytes under a directory this
