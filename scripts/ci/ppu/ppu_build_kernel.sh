# Build the sgl-kernel PPU wheel from source inside the CI container and install
# it over whatever the base image ships.
#
# Called unconditionally by ppu_install_dependency.sh: on PPU we build the
# repo's own kernel sources (dist name sglang-kernel, currently 0.4.6.post1) and
# force-reinstall it over the image's 0.4.3+v0.1.0.ppu2.1.1, so the kernel under
# test matches the source tree of the commit being tested (tested == code).
#
# v0.5.18 note: the compiled kernel no longer lives in a top-level sgl-kernel/
# tree (that was v0.5.13). It moved under python/sglang/kernels/aot/, and its
# build entry point is setup_ppu.py there. Pointing at the old sgl-kernel/ path
# was the reason the former build machinery went dead; this script targets the
# aot tree directly.
#
# Op-surface caveat (measured on the base image, 2026-09): the source 0.4.6 tree
# registers 5 fewer sgl_kernel:: ops than the image's 0.4.3 (bmm_fp8, moe_fused_gate,
# kimi_k2_moe_fused_gate, qserve_w4a8_*). Those are deliberately retired in 0.4.6
# (moe gate/topk routes through the unified Triton router; bmm_fp8 goes through
# flashinfer; qserve is not vendored), NOT a build defect. Overriding therefore
# switches the whole run onto the 0.4.6 generation by design.
#
# Coverage: this script is the single kernel-install entry point for EVERY PPU
# suite, because they all reach it through ppu_install_dependency.sh --
# pr-test-ppu (the three stages a/b/c) and nightly-test-ppu call it directly,
# while the answer / perf / pd-perf / accuracy(evalscope) suites call it from
# their run_*_suite_board.sh. So the source-build override applies uniformly to
# every PPU run, not just the PR gate.
#
# Wheel cache (NAS): a from-scratch compile costs ~200s. We cache the built
# wheel on the shared NAS mount, keyed by the kernel source tree + toolchain, so
# identical sources are compiled at most once ACROSS ALL of the suites above --
# whichever job runs first compiles and backfills, the rest get a ~10s install
# with no compile. Most PRs never touch python/sglang/kernels/aot/, so the common
# case is a cross-workflow cache HIT. See the cache section below for the key
# definition and override knobs.
#
# Prerequisites (all satisfied inside the PPU CI Docker container):
#   - torch with PPU CUDA support (already installed in base image; torch.version.cuda != None)
#   - PPU_SDK at /usr/local/PPU_SDK (baked into image)
#   - ninja / cmake / nvcc (already installed)
#   - git + network reachability for third-party (cutlass/flashinfer/triton);
#     verified reachable from the PPU runner under --network host.
#
# Environment variables (optional):
#   MAX_JOBS                     — ninja parallelism (default: min(nproc*2/3, 32))
#   SGL_KERNEL_THIRD_PARTY_DIR   — reuse a pre-populated third_party dir (e.g. NAS cache)
#                                  to skip the GitHub clone (default: aot build/_deps, cloned fresh)
#   SGL_KERNEL_CUTLASS_DIR       — point at a local cutlass checkout
#   SGL_KERNEL_SKIP_THIRD_PARTY  — set to 1 if third_party is already populated
#   SGL_KERNEL_LOCAL_VERSION     — PEP 440 local segment stamped onto the wheel
#                                  (default: ppu.src.<cache-key>, or ppu.src.g<sha>
#                                  when the cache is disabled). Stamped into the
#                                  checked-out pyproject metadata before the build;
#                                  it keeps the runtime PPU kernel-version guard
#                                  satisfied (that guard keys on a 'ppu' marker in
#                                  the installed version string).
#   SGL_KERNEL_WHEEL_CACHE       — set to 0 to disable the NAS wheel cache
#   SGL_KERNEL_WHEEL_CACHE_DIR   — cache root (default /nas_aisw/cache/sgl-kernel-wheels)
