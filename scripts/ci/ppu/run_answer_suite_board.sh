# Run one single-board Answer entry inside the worker pod.
#
# This is the body every entry of test-ppu-answer-k8s.yml executes on its board,
# held here rather than in the workflow because that workflow needs one job id
# per concurrent entry -- flytiger-eco/ppu-distributed-action derives both its
# NAS staging path and its K8s job name from $GITHUB_JOB, which every leg of one
# matrix shares -- and a local composite action is not available to those jobs:
# their runner group drives the job through a container hook, so the workspace
# the checkout populates is inside the container while the runner resolves
# `uses: ./` against its own filesystem, where nothing was ever written
# (measured, run 34085102675). Twelve copies of this script inlined into twelve
# jobs would be the only other shape, so what does not vary between entries
# lives here and what does arrives in the environment.

#                                  checkpoint -- a second copy in the workflow

# Gloo carries the CPU side of every process group SGLang creates, and it picks
# its address by resolving the pod's own hostname. On four of the eight nodes
# this batch landed on, that hostname has no address: six ranks logged torch's
# "Unable to resolve hostname to a (local) address ... Manually set the network
# interface to bind to with GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME" and fell back to loopback, while
# the other two raised out of the fallback instead, killing three entries at
# `new_group` before any weight was read (measured, run 34085800820, nodes
# swu10/swu12/swu15). Naming the interface takes the resolver out of the path,
# which torch's own message prescribes. `lo` is correct here and only here: this
# script serves the single-pod entries, whose ranks are processes in one network
# namespace. The multi-node entries must not copy it: they derive the interface
# facing their peers with answer_gloo_iface.sh instead.
