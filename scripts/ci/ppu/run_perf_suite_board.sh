# Run one single-board serving performance entry inside the worker pod.
#
# This is the body every entry of test-ppu-perf-k8s.yml executes on its board,
# held here rather than in the workflow for the reason the Answer board script
# records: that workflow needs one job id per concurrent entry, because
# flytiger-eco/ppu-distributed-action derives both its NAS staging path and its
# K8s job name from $GITHUB_JOB, and a local composite action is not available to
# those jobs -- their runner group drives the job through a container hook, so the
# workspace the checkout populates is inside the container while the runner
# resolves `uses: ./` against its own filesystem (measured, run 34085102675).
#
# A separate script from run_answer_suite_board.sh rather than a shared one with
# a flag: the two suites read different environment variables on purpose, so a
# change made for one cannot move the other's config, and the two lines can share
# a board without reading each other's settings.
#
# Reads:
#   SGLANG_PPU_PERF_TEST_CONFIG  absolute path of the reviewed config, and the
#                                one source for the visible devices and the
#                                checkpoint -- a second copy in the workflow
#                                could drift from what the test reads
#   PERF_SUITE                   registered suite name for run_suite.py

# job. HF_HUB_OFFLINE keeps the tokenizer load off the network on a cluster that
# has none, and this suite loads a tokenizer twice over -- once in the server and
# once in bench_serving, which encodes the synthetic prompts; HF_HUB_CACHE is the
# shared read-only cache the checkpoints' companion repositories were fetched
# into. PPU_SUPPORTS_FP8=0 reflects the board, not a preference.

# the Answer line, run 34085800820, nodes swu10/swu12/swu15). `lo` is correct
